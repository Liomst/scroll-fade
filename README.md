# scroll-fade
The scroll-fade library enhances webpage interactivity by making elements fade into view as they enter the viewport. It supports smooth fade animations for both individual elements and text, with word-by-word text fading. Multiple fade directions (up, down, left, right) can be applied, adding dynamic visual effects during scrolling.
